#+title: Resume stylesheet
#+author: Nishant Elkunchwar

The latex [[./resumestylesheet.sty][stylesheet]] for my resume.

[[./resume.tex][resume.tex]] is an example =.tex= file to be used with this stylesheet.

[[./resume_screen.pdf][resume_screen.pdf]], [[./resume_print.pdf][resume_print.pdf]] are resulting pdf files (generated by changing the colorscheme in the stylesheet).

I also use this stylesheet for exporting my cover letter from emacs org mode: use \maketitle for the "header" part, and the =chngpage= package to re-adjust margins.

TODO: add screenshots?
